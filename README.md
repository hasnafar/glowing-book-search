The application is a search engine. Once loaded, the user is given options to search for books and sign up/log in. 
Once a search is inputted and submitted, several search results show up that include the book's title, author, descritpion, image, and a link to the book. If a user is logged in, they can save the book to their account. Books can be removed as well. Users can then log out.
